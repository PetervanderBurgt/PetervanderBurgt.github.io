		<h3>About Myself</h3>
		<p>
			I am a Master student Embedded systems, with an interest in electronic projects and all things considering newer and upcoming technologies like Internet of Things and Machine Learning.
			Besides that I like to use technology in new and interesting ways to help create a better and more joyful world.
			</br></br>
			When I was younger I was already interested in technology and using exhisting things in new ways.</br>
			That's why in middle school I followed the Science, Engineering and Health track (Natuur en Techniek, Natuur en Gezonedheid).</br>
			Next to that, I followed Research and Design (Onderzoeken en Ontwerpen), which focusses on tackling a big project in a group in steps.
			First one does research, after which you set goals for the project, and finally you realise it.
			</br></br>
			The subject of Research and Design was a mayor factor in my choice for a Bachelor programme at the University of Twente.</br>
			There I graduated from Creative Technology, which is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on designing products with the user in mind. 
			It consists of three mayor branches, which are Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Industrial Design.</br>
			In this study I learned a lot, like for example brainstorming, goal-oriented design, circuit design, CAD Design, programming and user-centered design.
			After this study I wanted to focus more on the circuit design and programming side of the study and chose my master
			</br></br>
			At this moment I am following the Embedded Systems Masters Programme at the University of Twente.</br>
			Here I learn about Embedded Systems design, where hardware like FPGAs are programmed by using hardware description languages.
			Besides this, I followed subjects discussing Real-Time Systems, Data Science, Internet of Things, and Machine Learning.
			</br></br>
			In my free time I like to make electronic projects, to make my life or the life of others easier or are just fun.</br>
			Next to that, I'd like to go out on hikes and ride my sports bike.

				  <h4>Chairman Study Association Proto (2018 - 2019)</h4>
				  <p>
						Chairman of Study Association Proto, connected to the studies Creative Technology and Interaction Technology. During this time, I gained valuable soft skills and social skills.</br>
						As chairman of my board, I focused on creating an environment in which my fellow board members could do their work to the best of their abilities. This meant having evaluations, creating an open working atmosphere and taking care of smaller tasks.</br>
						to that, I handled communication inside the university whenever necessary and furthermore worked on the development of the association itself, including activities which either worked on the professional skills of the members, or were just fun activities. </br>
